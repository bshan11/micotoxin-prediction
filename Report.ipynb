    "### **1.1 Data Cleaning & Normalization**\n",
    "- **Outlier Removal**: Applied the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** to remove extreme values, ensuring model stability.\n",
    "- **Log Transformation**: Transformed the target variable (DON concentration) using `log1p()` to reduce skewness.\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**: Used **MinMaxScaler** to normalize spectral reflectance data, ensuring all features are within the same range for better model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**\n",
    "- **Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to retain **95% variance**, reducing 448 spectral bands to a smaller set of meaningful components.\n",
    "- **Rationale**: PCA helped remove noise and redundant information, improving model performance.\n",
    "- **Insights**: **PC2, PC3, and PC1 were the most influential components**, indicating that not all spectral bands contribute equally to prediction.\n",

    "### **3.1 Key Findings**\n",
    "✅ **XGBoost (Untuned) performed best** among all models tested based on raw performance.  \n",
    "✅ **PCA significantly improved model accuracy** by removing noise from spectral bands.  \n",
    "✅ **Random Forest was a strong alternative due to stability & interpretability.**  \n",
    "✅ **Deep Learning model (MLP) improved slightly with tuning but was still outperformed by tree-based models.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Observations**\n",
    "- **XGBoost (Untuned)** had the best overall accuracy, but tuning worsened its performance, likely due to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Random Forest (Tuned)** provided the second-best results, showing that tuning helped this model.\n",
    "- **MLP** had inconsistent results, indicating that deep learning models need more data to perform well.\n",
    "- **PCA** was essential in improving model accuracy by removing redundant spectral bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Areas for Improvement**\n",
    "🚀 **Increase Dataset Size** → Deep learning models (MLP) may improve with more training data.  \n",
    "🚀 **Try Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning** → Bayesian Optimization instead of GridSearchCV.  \n",
    "🚀 **Test Different Feature Engineering Approaches** → Instead of PCA, extract domain-specific spectral features.  \n",
    "🚀 **Explore Hybrid Models with Different Base Models** → Combine RF + MLP instead of RF + XGB.\n",
